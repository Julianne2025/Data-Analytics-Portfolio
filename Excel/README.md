Built practical tools that made month-end close fast and accurate for accountants working under fatigue and time pressure.

Skills include:

## Excel Files:
- Freight-JE-Upload-Macro.xlsm - Automated journal entry upload using Excel VBA.  						
JE Upload Form displaying 3 column GL account and dollar amounts.
Data converted into file for automatic upload into JD Edwards ERP (JDE) for accounting close.
Improved accuracy and efficiency by reducing month-end close errors caused by manual data entry keying or repetitive copy and pasting directly into JDE.

- Freight-GLCodeCheck-Macro.xlsm - VLOOKUP Macro compares GL codes retrieved from large consolidated freight invoice files to a list of valid freight GL codes from the Chart of Accounts
  before freight file is uploaded into JDE in order to identify invalid codes.  Prevents freight expense accrual upload issues related to error codes due to wrong GL accounts.
